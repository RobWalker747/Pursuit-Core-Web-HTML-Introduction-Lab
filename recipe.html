<hr><center><p>The classic and simple grilled cheese sandwich can be reimagined 
    multiple ways just by changing up the bread and cheese.</p></center></hr>

    <hr><blockquote><h3><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h3></blockquote>
<blockquote><ul>
        <li>2 ounces sliced melting cheese (about 2 slices), such as American, 
            Cheddar, muenster, Havarti, Swiss, fontina, Mozzarella, 
            Monterey jack, pepper jack, provolone.</li><br>
        <li>2 slices bread, such as white, rye, brioche, sourdough, potato, 
            whole wheat, pumpernickel.</li><br>
        <li>1 tablespoon fat, such as mayonnaise, butter or olive, chili or 
            coconut oil.</li><br>
    </ul></blockquote></hr> 

    <hr><blockquote><h3><strong>Directions:</strong></h3></blockquote>
<blockquote><ol>
        <li>Oven method (great for a crowd of six or fewer): Put a rimmed 
            baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven and preheat to 
            450 degrees F. Make one sandwich per person: Sandwich 2 slices 
            of cheese between 2 slices of bread. Spread or brush the outside 
            of the sandwich with 1 tablespoon of fat. Place on the preheated 
            baking sheet and cook until the cheese starts to melt, about 
            5 minutes. Flip the sandwich and bake until golden brown, 
            an additional 5 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Panini press method (for crispy crunchy sandwich that needs 
            minimal attention): Sandwich 2 slices of cheese between 2 slices 
            of bread. Preheat a panini press to medium heat. Spread or 
            brush the outside of the sandwich with 1 tablespoon of fat and 
            place in the press. Close the top and cook until lightly browned 
            and the cheese is melted, 5 to 6 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Skillet method (fool-proof and low-tech): Sandwich 2 slices 
            of cheese between 2 slices of bread. Preheat a skillet over 
            medium-low heat. Spread or brush the outside of the sandwich 
            with 1 tablespoon of fat and cook until lightly browned, 
            3 to 4 minutes. Flip the sandwich, and continue cooking until 
            browned and the cheese is melted, 3 to 4 minutes more.</li><br>
